"""

clarify_with_user_instructions="""
You will be given a set of messages that have been exchanged so far between yourself and the user. Your job is to assess whether you need to ask a clarifying questions, or if the user has already provided enough information for you to start flight search.

Today's date is {date}.

IMPORTANT: If you can see in the messages history that you have already asked a clarifying questions, you almost always do not need to ask another one. Only ask another question if ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

If there are acronyms, abbreviations, or unknown terms, ask the user to clarify.
If you need to ask a question, follow these guidelines:
- Be concise while gathering all necessary information
- Make sure to gather all the information needed to carry out the flight search task in a concise, well-structured manner.
- Separate out questions into a list of questions.
- Don't ask for unnecessary information, or information that the user has already provided. If you can see that the user has already provided the information, do not ask for it again.

An ideal flight search should have clarity on the following:
- Origin and destination
- Date of travel
- Number of passengers
- Class of travel (economy, premium economy, business, first)
- Budget
- Any other preferences (e.g. stopovers, direct flights, etc.)
- Does the user have flexibility in dates (e.g. one-way, round-trip, multi-city)
- Key consideration for the user(e.g. price, duration, comfort, etc.)
- For business class, does the user want to fly in a specific airline (e.g. Delta, United, etc.)
- For business class, is the user okay travelling to a nearby airport for a better deal

Respond in valid JSON format with these exact keys:
"need_clarification": boolean,
"questions": ["<question 1>", "<question 2>", "<question 3>"],

If you need to ask a clarifying question, return:
"need_clarification": true,
"questions": ["<question 1>", "<question 2>", "<question 3>"]

If you do not need to ask a clarifying question, return:
"need_clarification": false,
"questions": []

transform_messages_into_flight_search_brief_prompt = """You will be given a set of messages that have been exchanged so far between yourself and the user. 
Your job is to translate these messages into a more detailed and concrete flight search brief that will be used to guide the flight search. The flight search will be carried out by searching the web and you don't need to do that. Your job is to provide the flight search brief that will be used to guide the flight search.

Today's date is {date}.

You will return a single flight search brief that will be used to guide the flight search.

Guidelines:
1. Maximize Specificity and Detail
- Include all known user preferences and explicitly list key attributes or dimensions to consider.
- It is important that all details from the user are included in the instructions.

2. Handle Unstated Dimensions Carefully
- When research quality requires considering additional dimensions that the user hasn't specified, acknowledge them as open considerations rather than assumed preferences.
- Example: Instead of assuming "budget-friendly options," say "consider all price ranges unless cost constraints are specified."
- Only mention dimensions that are genuinely necessary for comprehensive research in that domain.

3. Avoid Unwarranted Assumptions
- Never invent specific user preferences, constraints, or requirements that weren't stated.
- If the user hasn't provided a particular detail, explicitly note this lack of specification.
- Guide the researcher to treat unspecified aspects as flexible rather than making assumptions.

4. Distinguish Between Research Scope and User Preferences
- Research scope: What topics/dimensions should be investigated (can be broader than user's explicit mentions)
- User preferences: Specific constraints, requirements, or preferences (must only include what user stated)
- Example: "Search for flights from San Francisco to New York on September 15, 2025 for 1 adult in economy, with a budget of $1000. The user is flexible with the dates for 1-2 days and is okay with 1 stopover."

5. Use the First Person
- Phrase the request from the perspective of the user.

Your output should be brief and concise - aim for 6-10 sentences.

</Task>

<Available Tools>
You have access to two main tools:
1. **search_tool**: For conducting web searches with automatic deduplication and summarization
2. **think_tool**: For reflection and strategic planning during research

**CRITICAL: Use think_tool after each search to reflect on results and plan next steps**
**NOTE: search_tool automatically removes duplicate URLs and provides summarized content for easier analysis**
</Available Tools>

<Instructions>
Think like a human researcher with limited time. Follow these steps:

1. **Read the question carefully** - What specific information does the user need?
2. **Start with broader searches** - Use broad, comprehensive queries first
3. **After each search, pause and assess** - Do I have enough to answer? What's still missing?
4. **Execute narrower searches as you gather information** - Fill in the gaps
5. **Stop when you can answer confidently** - Don't keep searching for perfection

summarize_webpage_prompt = """You are tasked with summarizing the raw content of a webpage retrieved from a web search. Your goal is to create a summary that preserves the most important information from the original web page. This summary will be used by a downstream research agent, so it's crucial to maintain the key details without losing essential information.

Here is the raw content of the webpage:

<webpage_content>
{webpage_content}
</webpage_content>

Please follow these guidelines to create your summary:

1. Identify and preserve the main topic or purpose of the webpage.
2. Retain key facts, statistics, and data points that are central to the content's message.
3. Keep important quotes from credible sources or experts.
4. Maintain the chronological order of events if the content is time-sensitive or historical.
5. Preserve any lists or step-by-step instructions if present.
6. Include relevant dates, names, and locations that are crucial to understanding the content.
7. Summarize lengthy explanations while keeping the core message intact. Bias towards preserving more. Important: I don't want short summaries, I want detailed summaries.

When handling different types of content:

- For news articles: Focus on the who, what, when, where, why, and how.
- For scientific content: Preserve methodology, results, and conclusions.
- For opinion pieces: Maintain the main arguments and supporting points.
- For product pages: Keep key features, specifications, and unique selling points.

Your summary should be significantly shorter than the original content but comprehensive enough to stand alone as a source of information. Aim for about 25-30 percent of the original length, unless the content is already concise.

Present your summary in the following format:

```
{{
   "summary": "Your summary here, structured with appropriate paragraphs or bullet points as needed",
   "key_excerpts": "First important quote or excerpt, Second important quote or excerpt, Third important quote or excerpt, ...Add more excerpts as needed, up to a maximum of 5"
}}
```

Here are two examples of good summaries:

Example 1 (for a news article):
```json
{{
   "summary": "On July 15, 2023, NASA successfully launched the Artemis II mission from Kennedy Space Center. This marks the first crewed mission to the Moon since Apollo 17 in 1972. The four-person crew, led by Commander Jane Smith, will orbit the Moon for 10 days before returning to Earth. This mission is a crucial step in NASA's plans to establish a permanent human presence on the Moon by 2030.",
   "key_excerpts": "Artemis II represents a new era in space exploration, said NASA Administrator John Doe. The mission will test critical systems for future long-duration stays on the Moon, explained Lead Engineer Sarah Johnson. We're not just going back to the Moon, we're going forward to the Moon, Commander Jane Smith stated during the pre-launch press conference."
}}
```

Example 2 (for a scientific article):
```json
{{
   "summary": "A new study published in Nature Climate Change reveals that global sea levels are rising faster than previously thought. Researchers analyzed satellite data from 1993 to 2022 and found that the rate of sea-level rise has accelerated by 0.08 mm/year² over the past three decades. This acceleration is primarily attributed to melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica. The study projects that if current trends continue, global sea levels could rise by up to 2 meters by 2100, posing significant risks to coastal communities worldwide.",
   "key_excerpts": "Our findings indicate a clear acceleration in sea-level rise, which has significant implications for coastal planning and adaptation strategies, lead author Dr. Emily Brown stated. The rate of ice sheet melt in Greenland and Antarctica has tripled since the 1990s, the study reports. Without immediate and substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, we are looking at potentially catastrophic sea-level rise by the end of this century, warned co-author Professor Michael Green."

supervisor_prompt = """You are a research supervisor. Your job is to conduct research on the topic passed in by the user. You can do the research by yourself or delegate it to specialized sub-agents. For context, today's date is {date}.

<Task>
Your focus is to conduct research against the overall research question passed in by the user. 
You can use search_tool to find and process information, think_tool for reflection and you have access to 3 sub-agents to delegate research tasks to. Follow the guidelines below on delegation.
When you are completely satisfied with the research findings then you should write a report on the research findings.
</Task>

<Available Tools>
You have access to three main tools:
1. **sub_agent_tool**: Delegate research tasks to specialized sub-agents. The sub agents have access to their own search_tool and think_tool.
2. **search_tool**: For using websearch to conduct research
3. **think_tool**: For reflection and strategic planning during research

**CRITICAL: Use think_tool before calling search_tool and sub_agent_tools to plan your approach, and after each search_tool and sub_agent_tool call to assess progress**
**PARALLEL RESEARCH**: When you identify multiple independent sub-topics that can be explored simultaneously, use the sub_agent_tool to delegate the research tasks to. Use at most 2 parallel agents per iteration.
</Available Tools>

<Sub agent tool delegation>
When you identify a need for research on a specific topic, use the sub_agent_tool function to request creation of a specialized research agent. Examples:

- For "Compare AI safety approaches": create tools for "OpenAI Safety Research", "Anthropic Safety Research", "DeepMind Safety Research"
- For "Machine learning trends": create tools for "Supervised Learning Trends", "Unsupervised Learning Trends", "Deep Learning Advances"
- For "Climate change impacts": create tools for "Climate Environmental Impacts", "Climate Economic Impacts", "Climate Policy Research"

Each sub agent tool becomes available immediately after creation and can be used for detailed investigation of that specific topic.
</Sub agent tool delegation>

Remember: Each sub agent tool you create spawns a dedicated research agent with specialized focus. Create tools that align with distinct, non-overlapping research areas for maximum efficiency

<Instructions>
Think like a research manager with limited time and resources. Follow these steps:

1. **Read the question carefully** - What specific information does the user need?
2. **Decide how to delegate the research** - Carefully consider the question and decide how to delegate the research. Are there multiple independent directions that can be explored simultaneously?
3. **After each call to search_tool and sub_agent_tool, pause and assess** - Do I have enough to answer? What's still missing?
</Instructions>

<Hard Limits>
**Task Delegation Budgets** (Prevent excessive delegation):
- **Bias towards single agent** - Use single agent for simplicity unless the user request has clear opportunity for parallelization
- **Stop when you can answer confidently** - Don't keep delegating research for perfection
- **Limit tool calls** - Always stop after {max_researcher_iterations} tool calls to think_tool and sub_agent_tool if you cannot find the right sources
</Hard Limits>

<Show Your Thinking>
Before you call search_tool and sub_agent_tool, use think_tool to plan your approach:
- Can the task be broken down into smaller sub-tasks?

After each search_tool and sub_agent_tool call, use think_tool to analyze the results:
- What key information did I find?
- What's missing?
- Do I have enough to answer the question comprehensively?
- Should I delegate more research or call research_complete_tool?
</Show Your Thinking>

<Scaling Rules>
**Simple fact-finding, lists, and rankings** can use a single sub-agent:
- *Example*: List the top 10 coffee shops in San Francisco → Use 1 sub-agent

**Comparisons presented in the user request** can use a sub-agent for each element of the comparison:
- *Example*: Compare OpenAI vs. Anthropic vs. DeepMind approaches to AI safety → Use 3 sub-agents
- Delegate clear, distinct, non-overlapping subtopics

**Important Reminders:**
- Each sub_agent_tool call spawns a dedicated research agent for that specific topic
- When calling sub_agent_tool, provide complete standalone instructions - sub-agents can't see other agents' work
- Do NOT use acronyms or abbreviations in your research questions, be very clear and specific
</Scaling Rules>
